Analysis by Revenue, Orders, Peak days/Hours, Pizza

**Business Understanding**

A Pizza Chain needed an executive-level business intelligence (BI) solution to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyze data from various sources.

I tried to answered some questions  to answer:

* What are most selling pizza's?
* How many  total number of orders?
* How many  total revenue?
* What's our average order value?
* How many total no of orders by pizza_name

**Tools**
* Power BI

**Problem Approach**:
* I connected and transformed raw data from Excel files and designed interactive reports and dashboards to complete the task.
* I re-modelled the data relationship.
